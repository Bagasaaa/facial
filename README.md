# FACIAL DETECTION

Facial detection is used to extract skin color, lipstick color, blush color, eyeshadow color, and foundation color.
This feature can categorize your makeup and provide makeup recommendations based on user occasions. 
The feature is built using YOLO V8 for Object Detection, OpenCV, and Flask API in essence.

Special thanks to those who built the models using object detection:
